<p>Alongside <code>easing</code>, there are several other options you can pass in when creating an animation:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-js'>
this.animate( 'selectedCity', cities[ index ], {
  easing: 'easeOut',
  duration: 300, // in milliseconds - default 400
  step: function ( t, value ) {
    // function that will be called immediately after
    // each step of the animation loop.
    //
    // `t` is a value between 0 (start) and 1 (end),
    // as determined by the easing function.
    //
    // `value` is the intermediate value
  }
}).then( function () {
  // .animate() returns a promise that fulfils
  // when the animation completes
});
</pre>

<p>Try using <code>ractive.animate()</code> to cycle the bar chart through a loop &ndash; each city's data is displayed for a couple of seconds before transitioning to the next one. To make it simple, the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> has been removed. If you get stuck, use the 'fix code' button to see one possible solution.</p>

<aside>
	<p>You can animate between numerical properties, and arrays or objects that contain numerical properties (nested however deep &ndash; though be aware that <span class='logo'>Ractive.js</span> doesn't check for cyclical data structures which will cause infinite loops!).</p>

	<p>Strings, such as the city's <code>name</code> in this example, are ignored, or rather set immediately on the first animation tick. (Future versions may include clever string interpolators Ã  la <a href='http://d3js.org/'>D3</a>.</p>
